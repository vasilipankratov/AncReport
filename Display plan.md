**1.** Barplot showing the percent of distant (degree = -1) relatives among national groups (Estonians, Finns, Russians, etc). 
Three bars per each donor group: you, average within this donor groups, average for the group with the most similar copying vector. 
The latter can be changed to the self-reported group.

**2.** Barplot showing the percent of distant relatives within Estonians from different maakonds.
Three bars per each donor group: you, average within this donor groups, average for the group with the most similar copying vector. 
The latter can be changed to the self-reported group.

**3.** A map with close relatives: Estonian relatives of degrees 7 and 6 are pooled together by maakond and shown by the size and colour of the Maakond. 
Estonians closer than 6th degree up to the degree which is ethical together with relatives from other ethnic groups are shown by symbols on the map. 
The symbol shows the relatedness degree and ethnicity of the relative by symbol type and color while it's position on the map shows where the relative comes from.
Perhaps a pannel beneath the map would be needed to show relatives with unknown geographic origin.
